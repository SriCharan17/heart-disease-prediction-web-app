Machine learning is a prominent approach for handling massive amounts of data in the healthcare sector. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyse vast, intricate medical data. The algorithms applied are “Naïve Bayes”, “Decision Tree”, “K-nearest neighbor”, “Support Vector Machine” and “Random Forest” algorithms.
The dataset is taken from the UCI heart disease patient database Cleveland that consists of 14 attributes which are crucial to proving the effectiveness of different algorithms. More information on dataset is on: https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset .
After analysing and comparing these algorithms, the results will portray the algorithm with the highest accuracy score when compared to other algorithms. "Random Forest" had the highest accuracy. 
A web app is built for showing result of the algorithm that had highest accuracy i.e., "Random Forest" based on "Streamlit" framework which can be used to create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. It can be installed from "Anaconda" Navigator or through a virtual environment.
Executing "lr_webapp.py" with Streamlit will run the app where it will take input of values for attributes and gives its prediction.
